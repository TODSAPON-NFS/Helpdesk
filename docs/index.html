    <p style="margin: 20px 0">The Helpdesk project is looking for contributors to help code, deploy, document, test and spread the word about the best general-purpose open-source helpdesk system. We use Ruby, Bootstrap, MongoDB and jQuery for the application, and there are always bugs or enhancements on the Issue Tracker that need sorting out. We need help with Docker. If you can Tweet about us, that would be really cool.</p>

	<h2>News</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Inventory Quantity</strong><br />
			The app has a record of the current stock quantity, but we need to have transaction history and the ability to issue material against a helpdesk ticket.
			<br /><small>December 27, 2017</small>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Preview release coming up soon</strong><br />
			We are planning the next pre-alpha release of the Helpdesk application. We will be running some basic sanity checks to make sure there aren't any blocking issues, but the system is far from production-ready.
			<br /><small>November 20, 2017</small>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Part Selection for Service Requests</strong><br />
			Did you have those times when somebody called to ask you if they could have a light bulb replaced? Or a pack of Ubuntu stickers for a conference? That's when you would attach a list of parts to the helpdesk ticket. This is a work-in-progress.
			<br /><small>November 18, 2017</small>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Attachments for Service Requests</strong><br />
			The service requests page now has document attachments. On our wishlist is the ability to add tags to attachments, and filtering of file extensions. The feature can be used to associate RFQs, quotations, and closure sign-offs to the service request.
			<br /><small>November 3, 2017</small>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Proof of Concept release</strong><br />
			We've just made a proof-of-concept release. The repo HEAD just might have something broken from time to time, so if you need a quick demo, please feel free to pick up this release for deployment.
			<br /><small>October 30, 2017</small>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>We are 2 weeks old!</strong><br />
			On October 15, 2017, we created our GitHub repository and made our first code commit. Since then, we had repo commits every single day and are nearing a Proof-of-Concept release. May we have good times ahead!
